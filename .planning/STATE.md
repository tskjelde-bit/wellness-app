## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 9-phase structure derived from 39 requirements across 6 categories
- [Roadmap]: Safety & consent framework placed before any pipeline work (Phase 2)
- [Roadmap]: Payment integration isolated as Phase 8 due to high-risk vendor complexity
- [Roadmap]: Phase 6 (UI) depends on Phase 4 (not 5), enabling parallel work with Phase 5

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Phase 1 -- Auth.js v5 is beta.30; monitor for breaking changes
- [Research]: Phase 2 -- Age verification scope depends on jurisdiction (DOB vs ID verification)
- [Research]: Phase 4 -- ElevenLabs voice selection must be finalized before build
- [Research]: Phase 8 -- High-risk payment processor vendor selection needs direct research
- [Research]: Vercel AUP for intimate wellness content not explicitly confirmed
